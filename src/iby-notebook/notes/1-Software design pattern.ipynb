    "\n",
    "In software engineering, a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply object-orientation or, more generally, mutable state, are not as applicable in functional programming languages.\n"

Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]</sup>, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.\n",

Since some authors see this as a step backward from [software reuse](/wiki/Software_reuse \"Software reuse\") as provided by [components](/wiki/Software_componentry \"Software componentry\"), researchers have worked to turn patterns into components.

Of particular interest are the Structure, Participants, and Collaboration sections. These sections describe a _design motif_: a prototypical _micro-architecture_ that developers copy and adapt to their particular designs to solve the recurrent problem described by the design pattern. A micro-architecture is a set of program constituents (e.g., classes, methods...) and their relationships. Developers use the design pattern by introducing in their designs this prototypical micro-architecture, which means that micro-architectures in their designs will have structure and organization similar to the chosen design motif.\n",
